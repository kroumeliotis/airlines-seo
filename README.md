## Abstract
 Digital marketing, especially search engine optimization (SEO), is an integral part of websites today. Airlines in the COVID-19 era have to use every possible means to survive despite the adverse conditions for both entrepreneurship and travel. Many of them have allocated resources and money to develop SEO strategies by applying SEO techniques to their websites to gain more visitors and bookings. Thus, this research is focused on analyzing airlines’ website presence as regards the implemented SEO techniques and their effect on airlines’ website traffic. In the first phase of the research, we gathered web data from 243 airline firms during a one-year observation period (December 2020–December 2021) using our own-developed tool. Furthermore, we proceeded to create an exploratory model using fuzzy cognitive mapping. From the technical SEO point of view and the descriptive analysis, we conclude that the traffic on airlines’ websites and, consequently, their sustainability are inseparably linked to the corresponding SEO techniques and technologies used.
